## About the Project
The PiPod 0W2 was my idea to bring together affordable raspberry pi components and the features of my favorite music players, especially the iPod. I want to make an open source and easily used media player for Linux and Windows users, but I have chosen to target the raspberry pi. I will release support for all platforms whenever I can.

### The Software
The project is using [Diet Pi](https://dietpi.com/) as the operating system and is the bulk of the heavy lifting for the actual software. Instead of making this project easier for myself and just using an already made media playing software like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) or [Dragon Player](https://apps.kde.org/dragonplayer/), I decided to code my own music player using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). Python does all the media playback and tracking of metadata and details, while pygame is the frontend and GUI. The reasoning for the extra work is because I want ***YOU*** to contribute!

### The Hardware
The project is aimed for the Rasberry Pi zero series boards, and uses DietPi as a base. I personally have used a Waveshare screen and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and some audio tools to create a basic all in one device that is a small form factor computer. When I get futher in the project I will give instructions and specifics on the build.


## Instructions
To navigate, use the up and down arrow keys. To go into a folder or into a new screen use Enter key. To play a found MP3 file, use enter agian, to go back a menu, use the left arrow.

When on the Music Info screen, use right arrow to pause and play, up and down to change volume, and the left arrow to go back to the previous menu.
