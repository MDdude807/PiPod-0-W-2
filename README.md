# PiPod 0W2

## About the Project
The PiPod 0W2 was my idea to bring together affordable raspberry pi components and the features of my favorite music players, especially the iPod. 

### The Software
The project is using [Diet Pi](https://dietpi.com/) as the operating system and is the bulk of the heavy lifting for the actual software. Instead of making this project easier for myself and just using an already made media playing software like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) or [Dragon Player](https://apps.kde.org/dragonplayer/), I decided to code my own music player using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news). Python does all the media playback and tracking of metadata and details, while pygame is the frontend and GUI. The reasoning for the extra work is because I want ***YOU*** to contribute! Like an iPod, I want there to be a games section, but other than a proprietary store like iTunes, I want the community to use Pygame to create and give their games for others to try.
